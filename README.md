# My Nvim Config
## Installation
- Make a folder in your home directory and name it .config if it doesn't exist yet: `mkdir ~/.config`
- Clone this git into `~/.config` folder: 
	`git clone https://github.com/happy42779/nvim.git`

## Configuration
There's no need to configure every plugin again, but installing some of the dependents needed by several plugins is necessary.
